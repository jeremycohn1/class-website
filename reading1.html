    <h3>1/13 Reading Response to: "Toph Tucker and Jasmine Lee on Why Restaurant Websites Are Good and We’re All Going to Miss Them"</h3>
    <p>
        Just last semester, I had an assignment in Web Development to find an old restaurant website and improve it. I snickered as I stumbled upon the La Pizza website, an archaic page displaying low quality photos of calzones and chef salads, and then “fixed” it for a grade. While it felt like I was doing La Pizza a service at the time, I felt a little bad taking away its original personality. Now after reading this interview with Toph and Jasmine, the concept of the nostalgic and beautiful nature of restaurant websites resonates with me even more.

        What I first took away from this reading was that conveying unique character is the primary reason why restaurant sites are so awesome. Playful animations, like Hibino’s dancing chef logo, special fonts, and illustrations bring a good restaurant website to life, contrasting those that are perfectly clean and organized yet corporate. Building character also means connecting with the audience. Showing off a restaurant’s history and mission make it feel relatable and homemade, even amplified by quirky visualizations. The best websites demonstrate creativity, authenticity, and a meaningful relationship with their patrons.

        But perhaps more importantly, being updated and modern does not mean a restaurant website is bad. While the interviewees note that new frameworks for websites can limit creativity, they also describe how websites of establishments like Dimes deli works so well despite being run on Squarespace. The world has to keep moving forward and advancing, but storytelling, clever human-computer interaction, and originality ought not be lost in the process. So really, we don’t have to lose – and miss – amazing restaurant websites, we just have to revive them.
