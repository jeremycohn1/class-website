    <h3>1/21 Reading Response to: "The New Turing Test"</h3>
    <p>
        Elan Ullendorff offers a beautifully hopeful angle at approaching our ever-changing relationship with artificial intelligence in <i>The New Turing Test</i>. His ideas feel like fresh air, freeing the audience from responsibility of judging whether a creative work is robot- or human-made, and presenting it with the opportunity to judge whether it emits soul. It pushes me to believe that no matter how far AI advances, our idiosyncrasies will always be capacble of trumping its inevitable lack of identity.
