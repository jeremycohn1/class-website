    <h3>1/27 Reading Response to: "Cyborgs vs rooms, two visions for the future of computing"</h3>
    <p>
        This writing challenges current tech industry trends towards a future in which our bodies gradually become fused with computers, and promotes one in which the physical spaces around us gradually become fused with computers. I can appreciate the author’s thinking as it accepts a high-tech, automated future but focuses on maintaining our “natural” lives in the process. Why become robots when the rooms in our homes, workplaces, and schools can become robot environments instead? However, a room like this could end up just being a bunch of stuff: cords, panels, and roombas that get dated and end up going to waste. So in order to combat the “cyborg” future, the “room” future must prioritize sustainability, comfort, and humanity.
