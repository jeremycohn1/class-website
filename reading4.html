    <h3>2/4 Reading Response to: "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?"</h3>
    <p>
        <b>1. What did you think about the essay? Did anything in particular resonate?</b>
        <br><br>
        This essay breaks down the common constraints that we often set for ourselves when considering the concept of a website. We frequently experience websites through the sole purpose of commerce, spaces that prioritize profit over people, when a website can be an environment for us to connect, learn and grow.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Laurel proposes a website could be a river, a garden, a thrown rock. If you have a website, what could your website be?</b>
        <br><br>
        I’d like to think of my first website as a stream. It’s small but it has a clear direction and has the opportunity to grow as it gathers resources in its surroundings. Perhaps one day it will connect to rivers, lakes, oceans.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. What can you do with a website that you make yourself that you can’t do if someone else makes your website?</b>
        <br><br>
        You can develop its identity in a way only you can, and you can manage it in the way you want. For example, if your website is a shelf, the wood has <i>your</i> tree markings, and <i>you</i> get to pick how books are stacked or organized, which books stay, and which ones get removed.
