    <h3>2/16 Media Response to: "Eno"</h3>
    <p>
        The documentary “Eno” by Gary Hustwit feels special, taking us on a journey to learn about Brian Eno as a rockstar, an artist, and a human being. Hustwit uses brilliant pacing, sometimes flipping quickly and erratically between frames to show Eno’s cutting-edge creativity, and sometimes slowing down to demonstrate his deep wisdom.

        Eno shares several observations, often from a strange perspective, but after chewing on them, their resulting flavors begin to make sense. He views thoughts and knowledge as the sum of our "electrical" feelings, citing his core childhood feelings to be (1) a specific shade of purple, (2) Ketty Lester, and (3) a sunset over the water. This made me think about my own feelings, and what imagery has stayed consistent over the course of months or years at a time.

        Eno describes music as paintings in the context of time, which makes me think of a pianist who designated a color to each piece he played and tried to emulate the feelings of that color while he played. I also was intrigued by his beliefs about errors. Just as I’ve learned through jazz or in my improv class, Eno talks about errors not as moments of failure but as moments of opportunity: a mistake simply becomes the new truth, and we all must accept its veracity. Viewers of the documentary see this philosophy firsthand when he seems to blow up a new latex-covered musical device but immediately becomes engrossed by the new “messed-up” sound that the instrument emits.

        Finally, I found his philosophy on our human lives quite interesting: we are small, meaningless beings, specks on a full moon; furthermore, our gradually shrinking brains are effectively nothing unless they are blended as powerful combined entities, and the purest form of cerebral connection is art. 
        <br><br>
        It is clear why Eno is such a significant focal point for a documentary. He has always been ahead of his time, leading evolutions of artistry and thought, and even as he ages, he has kept up with technological advancements to stay relevant in the spheres that matter to him. I hope to take inspiration from Eno during the remainder of my time in Visual Principles, at WashU, and beyond.
